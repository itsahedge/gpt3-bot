https://beta.openai.com/docs/model-index-for-researchers

GPT-3.5 series is a series of models that was trained on a blend of text and code from before Q4 2021. The following models are in the GPT-3.5 series:

### code-davinci-002 

is a base model, so good for pure code-completion tasks

### text-davinci-002 

is an InstructGPT model based on code-davinci-002

### text-davinci-003 

is an improvement on text-davinci-002


## GPT-3 Models

### text-davinci-003
Most capable GPT-3 model. Can do any task the other models can do, often with higher quality, longer output and better instruction-following. Also supports inserting completions within text.	

### text-curie-001	
Very capable, but faster and lower cost than Davinci.	

### text-babbage-001	
Capable of straightforward tasks, very fast, and lower cost.	

### text-ada-001
Capable of very simple tasks, usually the fastest model in the GPT-3 series, and lowest cost.
